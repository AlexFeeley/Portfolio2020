# 2021 Personal Website
The content of this website, but not the theme, was updated for the 2021-2022 school year. 

# 2020 Personal Website
My personal website from the 2020-2021 school year. I've decided to move on from avoiding JS and
dive into React by re-making my website. Check it out: [alexfeeley.com](https://www.alexfeeley.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and hosted with Netifly. It has
served as my first experience with React and Javascript, allowing me to explore basic web
development.
